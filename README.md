**The goal for this project is to create a personal website with landing page, blog and youtube pages.**

**First tasks that come to my mind:**

- [ ] create basic pages with routing folders for home / blogs / blog post / youtube / single youtube video
- [ ] need to decide on database and implement some sort of authentication for only myself (env username and password maybe)
- [ ] need to think about rich text (where to save blog images)
- [ ] some kind of automated ci/cd and deployment of the app (github actions and maybe dockerized app with aws ECS)
